            I hate to sound like a person who came from the 1980s-1990s, but I
            think the book should have gone further with the message on how you

            that the internet infrastructure in the rest of the world might not
            even be as good as in a metropolitan area around a major US city.

            Making images accessible is also a very good subtopic to pay
            attention to.
