        <h1>Week 12 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            In our class, this is another "non-programming" chapter and week.
            (I will get into why Chapter 12's JavaJam assignment is not really
            instructive anymore.)
        </p>
        <h2>General Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            The book gets into e-commerce.  It is by far the furthest
            digression from writing HTML, but most normal clients will likely
            require sites that need to be static pages, not bare HTML and CSS.
            So, it is good to be in touch with reality - even if it is pretty
            gnarly and gross.  Fortunately, it is not more so than required.
        </p>
        <p>
            I sort of wished the book mentioned that various sites, such as
            airline ticket sites, are known to manipulate prices if you return
            to the same ticket listing, rather than immediately buy the ticket
            offer without the chance to do any price comparison.  (It is even
            suspected - or basically known, even "unofficially" - that sites,
            such as Ebay and Expedia, dynamically change listed prices to
            anyone who does not use a VPN.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Under "Risks of E-Commerce", security issues and privacy issues are
            mentioned.  Well, unfortunately you cannot teach a mindset to
            people.  For the first, the book is extremely outdated - no one
            should be entering a credit card or login credentials to any site
            that does not have HTTPS (the padlock, made possible by TLS and
            SSL).  For the second, basically do not expect any reasonable level
            of privacy from any law enforcement entities when  the site most
            likely stores any amount of data about you in any database...
            unless you are Bitwarden, apparently.  However, Bitwarden has a
            business model that relies on trust and E2EE and thus is  not your
            typical online business (which is technically different from
            e-commerce, but still worth mentioning).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can significantly promote the overall privacy of your website
            by not using Google Analytics.  (First, ask yourself if you
            <emph>really</emph> need analytics; and if the answer is still
            "yes", then strongly consider using open-source alternatives that
            are built from the ground up to provide analytics without draconian
            privacy invasive features.  We live in a post-Snowden revelation
            era, so the textbook should expect HTTPS internet connections to be
            the sane default, not bare HTTP.
        </p>
        <p>
            One passing thought: there is a lot of business-to-business
            e-commerce activity, such as Lenovo.  To be honest, until very
            recently (when Lewis from Unbox Therapy started the ThinkPad X1
            Carbon and X1 Nano hype train), Lenovo never seemed to be widely
            known to your average consumers of computers.  (I am definitely
            biased, for sure - even though I am starting to cool off because I
            would like to see more devices not ship with Intel ME... but that's
            a major digression.)  This is because Lenovo (and more
            specifically, the contemporary versions of ThinkPads) are typically
            sold via business-to-business transactions.  For example, schools
            (such as universities) and other corporate businesses buy a lot of
            ThinkPads (or ThinkCentres), but these products do not usually get
            the spotlight attention of your average everyday consumer.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 12.5</h3>
        <p>
            The e-commerce issues are certainly lacking.  For example,
            intellectual property is the leading cause to why Intel ME exists
            in all modern hardware.  Cyber security could be its own course.
            The "Taxation" bullet point is mostly outdated now, since major
            online sites, such as Ebay and Amazon, enforce state sales tax -
            not to mention that the textbook author is a bit old-fashioned and
            apparently believes in the "goo-goo good government", since the
            following was written: "Our local governments are losing revenue
            for funding worthwhile programs." While factually true, I think the
            author is basically borderline naive to trust the government so
            much like this - has she ever thought about the assassination of
            JFK, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, 9/11, or the Snowden
            revelations?  Probably not, but that is speculation and we should
            not gossip like that.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 12.6</h3>
        <p>
            I have no idea why this section exists.  To introduce the concept
            of encryption is probably alright, but most students are trying to
            just an IT major as fast as possible (many of them probably do not
            even need to perform any security related tasks on a day-to-day
            basis for their actual work).  I suppose the section is trying to
            work towards digital certificates (for websites, but also for
            drivers... but that is mostly for Windows or Apple - I am sure
            drivers can be signed in Linux, but I am not sure how that is
            implemented.)  The textbook ought to at least mention that you can
            get a certificate for your own site pretty easily and for free with
            Certbot (which was created by the EFF) and Let's Encrypt.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 12.7</h3>
        <p>
            For Section 12.7, this brought up to me (for this week's
            assignment) that one of the few components of the internet that is
            not open-source is payment processing systems with credit (or
            debit) cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have never heard of "stored-value cards".  Are these like MiFARE
            cards used for paying for public transit rides?
        </p>
        <p>
            Digital wallets are mentioned.  I supposed these are more like
            2013-era technology that had to be significantly revised to still
            function in 2021.  For example, I have never heard of Yahoo Wallet
            - though it sounds like a literal honeypot, since Yahoo is always
            getting hacked for absolutely no good reason.  There is also this
            hardware wallet called Visa Checkout, but honestly Venmo and
            CashApp are more usable and recognizable in 2021.  I feel this
            textbook should not be mentioning these, since the only ones that
            have made it to 2020-2021 are Google/Android Pay and Apple Pay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh boy - I do not know why "digital cash" gets mentioned, i.e.
            cryptocurrency coins.  Yes, the textbook is really showing its age.
            It lists Bitcoin as if it is the only widely implemented
            cryptocoin, as if it is the year 2013 and Daniel Fraga was still
            posting videos on YouTube.  The only worthwhile cryptocoins are
            Monero and Zcash - though the latter is a bit weaker with respect
            to anonymity than the former.  Lastly, I am baffled by the mention
            that Dell somehow accepts Bitcoin payments, but somehow it is dang
            near impossible to find the correct landing page to purchase Dell
            laptops that have Ubuntu preinstalled, instead of Windows???  What
            about purchasing a Dell laptop with no built-in webcam??? On the
            other hand, the author is not trying to scam the readers with
            fraudulent cryptocurrency coin hype at the very least - unlike all
            of these cryptocoin YouTubers... at the very least recommend
            hardware wallets to store cryptocoins, instead of just repeating
            the fad about their being "the future".
        </p>
        <h3>Section 12.8</h3>
        <p>
            Section 12.8 is the most important for the weekly assignment.  You
            can probably get most of your ideas from this section alone.
        </p>
        <h2>Weekly Assignment, But No JavaJam</h2>
        <p>
            There is a reason why our class skipped the JavaJam assignment: the
            dummy PHP script provided by the textbook for the online store no
            longer functions, since the script apparently no longer exists on
            the companion textbook website.  (Maybe the publisher and author
            should have worked out some public Git solution, such as on
            GitHub...)  Anyways, the JavaJam site will look more "complete",
            even though the textbook treats most of the chapters after Chapter
            9 as effectively self-contained.
