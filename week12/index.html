            <p>Instead of a JavaJam assignment this week, we completed #2 from Web Research, which was about researching 3 online shopping cart systems that I feel would be easy to use and display my findings regarding the following attributes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product name</li>
                <li>Brief description</li>
                <li>Cost</li>
                <li>Web server requirements (if any)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Table of Results</h2>
            <p>
                Below is a table that summarizes my findings.<br>
                (All information and costs were current as of December 6, 2020.)
