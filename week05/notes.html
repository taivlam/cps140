        <h1>Week 5 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            This is the second "no programming" chapter.  (The first one was
            Chapter 1, the third one is Chapter 10, and the fourth and
            empirically last one is Chapter 12 - because our class omitted
            Chapter 12's JavaJam assignment.)

            There are a lot of "common sense" aspects of creating a website for
            your users (that aren't necessarily about code writing), since that
            is what HTML and CSS are used for.  Considerations such as target
            audience, site organization, and visual design - among others - are
            aspects of a website that are essential to having a good website.
            Visual design on the web could be an entire semester long course.

            Of course, this is a lot of information that should be read and
            understood, but not necessarily memorized.

            I wish the book was more "modern" and socially aware to include
            things such as dark patterns so that we don't get deceptive
            websites that taunt ordinary end-users with the borderline evil
            things they include in most implementation of websites today,
            dancing on the fine line between legal and illegal.

            Accessibility is a thematic motif that comes again and again in
            HTML.  Don't underestimate those who are visually impaired - that's
            why screen readers exist!  Make sure to include <code>alt</code>
            attributes for image elements!  (This is also a good fail-safe for
            any end-user who somehow experiences a client-side error - in this
            case, it is highly likely that the <code>alt</code> text of an image
            will still be processed.)
