            There are many aspects of CSS to cover.  However, don't fret!  You
            basically learn about embedded CSS and external style sheets.  The
            former is excellent for a site that has only 1-2 total web pages.
            On the other hand, the latter is good for recycled/reoccurring CSS
            rule sets used across a web site with more than 5-10 pages.  Two
            different approaches to CSS exist and it is up to you to decide 
            which approach to take so that your web page isn't just black text 
            on a white background - or, namely bare HTML.

            CSS brings a little color to your web pages.  CSS is the basic
            technique for achieving this.  There might be static site
            generators, but at their core they still use CSS with a bunch of 
            extra stuff (probably imported fonts).  It's also important to type
            the syntax correctly for CSS more than HTML.

            For the mistakes I've made in this chapter, I feel HTML syntax
            errors tend to be more forgiving and still render the pages.
            However, CSS errors tend to be subtly pernicious - either they
            cause something to silently fail and their effects only start to
            become more apparently when the site starts adding many more CSS
            rules; or elements will just not render.  I felt that it was a bit
            harder to debug CSS syntactical errors than for those in HTML.

            By the way, VSCodium is great at detecting syntactical errors in
            HTML and CSS.  (Don't use VSCode, since Microsoft builds that
            version with telemetry.)  Use it as an automated check against
            syntactical typos, but don't rely on it too much.  No matter how
            quirky the autotabbing is on Vim's "smart" tabbing, I still prefer
            Vim's configuration over VSCodium's attempt at autotabbing.
