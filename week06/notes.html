        <h1>Week 6 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            Page layout has a lot of information, but you do not need to
            memorize this.  (I will probably say this frequently.)  Doing the
            Hands-On Practice exercises throughout the chapter will more
            clearly show you what is going on in the information being conveyed
            in the chapter.
        </p>
        <h2>General Collected Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Very important</em>: removing the underline with CSS in
            hyperlinks/URLs will be frequently required in all subsequent
            chapters - this is the most important takeaway from Section 6.7.
            Also, the removal of list markers in unordered lists is mentioned
            here, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 6.8 covers interactivity of the mouse (i.e., hovering,
            keyboard focus, and if you already visited the hyperlink).  (Did
            you hear that? You don't need to implement this with tracker-heavy
            JavaScript!)
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Random note</em>: I will just say it here, because there is
            not an easy place to put this fact - this book tells you to rewrite
            your Practice exercise HTML from scratch more often than it should.
            I have no idea why, but this manual "resourcing" is more tedious
            and time consuming rather than being conductive to learning.  I
            will not indicate everywhere where you can do this, but always do a
            self-check before starting from scratch if you can reuse the latest
            completed Practice exercise as a skeleton to do the next Practice
            exercise, especially if the book does not say to reuse prior HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learn how to retab in Vim on any chapter provided templates for
            Practice exercises - ideally with macros.  (I am saying this with 
            the power of in hindsight).  The example solutions and provided
            templates tab in a very Windows-like mindset.  Tabbing is done on
            an ad hoc and visual basis and not in a convention that offers
            consistency.  I know tabbing does not affect the rendering of HTML
            and CSS, but it keeps the HTML code, as a markdown language,
            readable and does not promote students to go on to blindly rely and
            use minified CSS themes from Google or something like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only use the "4-value" abbreviation convention, shown below, if you
            wish to set a CSS rule and then forget it/effectively never change
            it again.  It turns out that, despite Chapter 6 encouraging you to
            learn and start using this convention, is actually
            counterproductive later down the road for the subsequent chapters
            (because you start giving some top/bottom/right/left border some
            unique and nonsymmetric properties, so it turns out to be tedious
            for going back to do bespoke and narrow-scope CSS edits).<br><br>

        <h2>Some Typos and Mistakes I Noticed</h2>
        <p>
            Besides the usual run-off TTF code sections, there are a few typos
            and other minor errors that caused me a bit of confusion.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In Figure 6.18, the displayed picture is either weird or wrong.
                If I recall correctly, the figure looks nothing like what that
                point in Practice 6.3 is supposed to look like.  (I am talking
                about the copy of the book from Library Genesis, since I did
                not want to be online 24/7 when writing HTML on BryteWave.)
            </li>
                Both solution files for Practice 6.3 left the "i"s out of "is"
                in the second instance of "This is a sentence."
            <li>
                In Practice 6.8, it should have mentioned that all picture
                files are of the same dimensions, so that we do not have to
                manually check the dimensions of each picture - not all of us
                use sxiv or whatever to quickly obtain all image dimensions via
                a 1-liner command on the CLI...
            </li>
            <li>
                Practice exercise 6.10 should have specified that the box
                shadow should be dark grey (<code>#828282</code>) with a blur
                radius of <code>5px</code> and that light grey background is
                <code>#030303</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the JavaJam assignment, the picture height should actually
                be <code>175px</code> (cross referenced by HIREZ's assignment
                when the site was active) instead of <code>250px</code>. IIRC, 
                <code>250px</code> will heavily distort the pictures.
            </li>
        </ul>
