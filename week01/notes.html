        <h1>Week 1 - Notes</h1>
        
        <h2>Note</h2>
        There was no HTML coding during Week 1, since learning how to write 
        basic HTML and the JavaJam assignment did not start yet.
        
        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        Originally, I was going to write down a bunch of defintions, but then I 
        changed my mind (since you can read the textbook for those terms, and 
        the "real world" cares more about how you can design a website rather 
        than if you can remember a word by word defintion of DNS or some other 
        term).
        
        Also, I was originally going to cheese my way through the notes for 
        each chapter by writing them in Markdown, but then I realized that is 
        not what we learned in the HTML class.  So, I ditched the Markdown in 
        order to stay within the spirit of HTML.
        
        <h2>Observations</h2>
        There is a lot of reading but no "programming" in this chapter.  I see 
        this as a very good basis for teaching high school classes.  (What 
        should be taught, instead of Microsoft Word and Excel, which change 
        their GUIs every year for no reason.)

        Also, CERN is involved with the formation of the Internet.  (I guess 
        it's not that surprising in retrospect, considering that some poeple 
        from CERN helped to create ProtonMail.)

        Lastly, the history shows that the Internet usage did not skyrocket 
        until businesses were allowed on the Internet... I guess we now know why
        the Internet today is so messed up due to  Facebook and ads everywhere.

        Ultimately, there is a lot of information that is good to read once but 
        not necessarily memorize.  It definitely gives you a crash course 
        overview of all things Internet related.  Any one of these could be 
        expanded into its own respective course or fields of study 
        (cybersecurity, media and Internet literacy, and many more).

        This chapter basically serves as a source of sheer information that could 
        be pulled for the weekly quiz, though it really does get the point 
        around that "the Internet" is simply some other person's or other 
        people's computer(s).
