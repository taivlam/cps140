        <h1>Week 9 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            This chapter is about online forms.  Online forms are more relevant
            than expected because even online search engines and login screens
            are forms at heart but dressed up to not look like the forms you
            fill out for online forms.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the knowledge of HTML for forms is practically only half
            of what you need for making a working form.  The other half is the
            back end server-side processing, though such knowledge of
            programming various databases are outside the scope of this class.
            (That is most likely how form logic, such as checking for invalid
            forms of phone numbers, are checked after submission - if that is
            not already done in real time with JavaScript).
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where you learn what a select list, radio button, and check
            box looks like.
        </p>
        <h2>General Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Again, the chapter is quite long because it is unavoidably full of
            reference information contained in tables and necessary figures to
            show how options will render.
        </p>
        <p>
            Otherwise, there is not much to this chapter, other than getting
            yourself to plow through reference information and doing the
            Practice Exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
            Password boxes are even components of forms - though they most
            likely need server-side processing in order to be actually useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrolling text boxes are nearly not used frequently enough to
            accept longer free-form responses, in my experience - even for
            surveys.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the way, I think website builders should stop using HTML to
            launch the user's default e-mail client.  Instead, the e-mail
            address should be displayed for users to decide for themselves what
            client they wish to send an e-mail with.  (This is just my opinion,
            but the book also mentions this point in this chapter.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I would prefer to always have a standard submit button.  It is
            always more inherently extensible and interlopable with
            accessibility and also just plain simple - keeping in line with
            KISS.  Having a custom image button for form submission seems like
            a fad from the 2000-nots that has not aged well - sort of like Word
            Art.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, forms can be styled with CSS, just like most other
            ordinary elements of HTML that have visual outputs/rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Server-side processing is the second half of making online forms
            IRL - otherwise, you have this situation like with the Wired Sounds
            for Wired People site.  (If you have heard of this "Internet
            oddity" before, then do not be duped - allegedly, there is no
            server-side processing for the mysterious login page to even work.)
        </p>
        <p>
            The book has you practice with a trivial dummy server-side script.
            For the real world, web programmers are typically split into two
            heuristic tribes (unless the team is so small that you have to do
            <emph>everything</emph> yourself): front-end and back-end.
            Front-end developers usually take care of what the website looks
            visually for end users but should be able to pull ready made
            back-end scripts when needed (so, everything in the book so far,
            and some more), while back-end users have to set up database
            processing and other server-side processes that allow for site
            interactivity interesting enough for normal end-users to make use
            of.  However, the back-end programmers should be mindful that they
            are helping make a usable end product.  (The front-end developers
            need to be mindful of the value of the back-end developers, too -
            much like visible actors and backstage hands in a theater play.)
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML5 offers some unique form fields that base HTML does not,
            though most of these should be obvious for the usable Internet
            today or can be looked up in references as required.  E-mail, URL,
            and telephone number fields are pretty obvious.  Search fields are
            nearly taken for granted, given how ubiquitous search engines are.
            Datalist form controls (i.e., picking from a presorted list of
            options in a drop-down menu) is also pretty direct with its
            purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sliders (dragging a pointer along a line segment) seem rather
            fancy.  I personally would prefer to use a spinner (a number box
            that you click up/down to increase/decrease the number) is better,
            since not everyone using the Internet is able to have fine motor
            skills to drag a slider, especially if it is pretty granular in
            interval increments with respect to the total scale range.
        </p>
        <p>
            Calendar form inputs heuristically have only two visual looks,
            since basically all web browsers are Firefox-based or
            Chromium-based.
        </p>
        <p>
            Color-wells are not common, but it is nice to know and have as an
            option.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of progressive enhancement is repeated at the end of
            this chapter.

        <h2>JavaJam Assignment</h2>
        <p>
            The JavaJam site assignment is straightforward.  You are only
            creating a Jobs page and making a form to accept job applications.
            Of course, this form is way too simplistic for the real world.
            Most businesses would simply use job application services, probably
            as a "plugin", to accept job applications so that it would have
            rigorous and robust online form rules and validations.
