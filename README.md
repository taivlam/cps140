# CPS 140 - Fall 2020

This is my GitHub repository for my work in CPS 140, fall 2020.

* You may find the GitHub Pages site, which is where this repo "lives, here at:

## The "Origin Story"

I started to invest effort and time in simply setting up this repo for submitting source code and to show that my JavaJam Coffe House site works, after completing my weekly assignments, because Blackboard (erroneously) complained that my CSS file had a security risk for Week 4 and refused to let me upload my assignment.

Setting up a GitHub Pages site was just a convenient side effect and an inevitable item to cross off of my bucket list.

## Licenses and Other Whatnot

I suppose I should assign some legitimate FOSS license to this repository at some point, but that's probably only going to happen once I have more time after this class is over... (I'm still getting the hang of how things work on GitHub - I mean, I didn't even have a ```README.md``` until the last week of this class!)
