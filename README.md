## Background

This is my GitHub repository for my work in CPS 140, fall 2020.

* The textbook used was _Web Development and Design Foundations with HTML5_ (9th Edition) by Terry Felke-Morris.

* In my class, we mostly followed the book with the JavaJam Coffee House project as part of our weekly HTML/CSS assignments.

* Even though the book used I primarily assumed users were on Windows, I viewed this class as an opportunity to force myself to use Vim as much as possible (the CLI version of gVim, with only a few modifications for "smart" indentation and syntax highlighting) while on Linux.  I've used Vim before, but not seriously; and it was mostly supplemented by either `nano` or `gedit`.

* Also, I occasionally used VSCodium, the completely F(L)OSS version of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code/VSCode that has telementry/tracking removed.  VSCodium definitely helped me to avoid a few severe HTML/CSS errors or mishaps - however, this probably matters if coding is part of your daily job and your livelihood depends on it.

(Thanks to [PrivacyToolsIO](https://www.privacytools.io/software/productivity/) for mentioning VSCodium!)

## Some Random, Not Very Nicely Catagorizeable Rant Points

Not like I'm an expert, but - sooner or later - the only way to learn how to program/code (in any language - just start _somewhere_, similar to Linux) is to make silly mistakes that cost you at least 1-2 hours of confusion; only to find out that you've forgotten the final `;` in a CSS rule or you forgot the opening/closing HTML tag.

Adding something like the ALE plugin (for IDE functionality in Vim - which I didn't do), pimping out your `.vimrc` configuration file to supercharge your programming (which I didn't really do), or using VSCodium (which I sometimes did) isn't going to autocomplete the task of coding _for you_ - well, at least until the singularity or Hollywood-esque AI takeover happens.

## The "Origin Story"

I started to invest effort and time in simply setting up this repo for submitting source code and to show that my JavaJam Coffe House site works, after completing my weekly assignments, because Blackboard (erroneously) complained that my CSS file had a security risk for Week 4 and refused to let me upload my assignment.

Setting up a GitHub Pages site was just a convenient side effect and an inevitable item to cross off of my bucket list.

## Hoping to Not Get Slammed by Pearson, Like `youtube-dl`

I'm definitely in a legal gray area for keeping a repo of my JavaJam Coffee House work on GitHub... though (hopefully) things will be ok for me empirically in the future. 

I mean, there are at least 2 other (rather old-ish) repos for this same textbook, albeit for the 6th editions of the textbook, on GitHub - though there's little to no descriptions/documentaitons with them, and those users haven't really used GitHub since taking their classes (not like any of that matters).  However, those repos aren't too popular and it takes some digging around on DuckDuckGo or Startpage to find them.

All I hope is that the reason of "this repo was created for purely educational purposes and was definitely not intended for commercial purposes" is good enough of a rationale to prevent Pearson from attempting an unfair and unjust copyright takedown of this repo - the recent (unrelated for non-analogous reasons) attempted takedown of `youtube-dl` comes to mind...

### Oh Yeah - a Disclaimer on "Cheating"

On one hand, I suppose the people actually stuck with the "kindergartner" mindset (which is objectively bad - but I won't get into that, because this repo is for my schoolwork, not my waxing philosophy opinions) can try to argue that I'm "enabling" students to cheat.  However, on the other hand, I'm going to tell those who are still using the 9th edition of the book to write the code themselves, even if they happen to end up rewriting my code.

It's a bit like tracing when one first learns to draw by teaching him/herself - of course you shouldn't go around and tell everyone that your trace is your own original artwork.  Yet, as an absolute beginner, one can still learn quite a lit by tracing in art.  As long as the ultimate goal is self-sufficiency (i.e., not longer tracing/copying code anymore in the near future), there is nothing wrong with the utilitarian MO of tracing in art or copying code in programming - especially when one is starting in their own respective crafts.

And, since I'm not the devil's advocate academic obsessed with "hypothetical" situations and putting of cardboard-front opinions that s/he doesn't actually believe in, I wouldn't be saying all of this if I also didn't experience this, either.

## Licenses and Other Whatnot

I suppose I should give some legitimate and/or recognized FOSS license to this repository at some point, but that's probably only going to happen once I have more time after this class is over... (I'm still getting the hang of how things work on GitHub - I mean, I didn't even have a ```README.md``` until the last week of this class!)
