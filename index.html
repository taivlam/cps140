        <h1>CPS 140, Fall 2020</h1>
        <p>
            This GitHub project page is where I will display all of my work for
            CPS 140, starting on October 4, 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The real reason why this project page exists is because I got irked
            at Blackboard, after it refused to upload my CSS file for Week 04
            as an individual file (since BB mistakenly claimed the CSS file was
            a security risk &mdash; I mean c&#39;mon, this is an Intro to HMTL
            college class, not a cybersecurity/penetration testing college
            class!).  So, I made a GitHub project page as a way to turn in my
            weekly assignments, instead of using Blackboard to individually
            upload each HTML/CSS file.
        </p>
        <p>
            (Maybe the people at Blackboard could actually learn a hint of what
            cybersecurity is by watching <i>Mr.&nbsp;Robot</i>...)
