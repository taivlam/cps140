        <h1>Week 10 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            Another non-HTML writing chapter.  I probably cheated in my notes
            for Chapter 9 by mentioning some facts that are better suited to
            discuss for Chapter 10 or Chapter 12.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, even if you do not care about online commerce (or are
            disgusted by the commercial side of the Internet), it is still good
            to know how sites should be maintained.
        </p>
        <h2>General Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            There is one model of the development cycle, but this is probably
            only of note if you are in IT doing the business side of things
            (after the quiz is over).
        </p>
        <p>
            Some automated testing methods are suggested, but most likely all
            websites are using a form of Git for version control, if such
            platforms do not already have their own continuous integration (CI)
            and continuous build (CB) solutions and testing.  Usability could
            be its own technical course, if not a series on its own.  However,
            that is commonly overlooked in today's world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Domain names are mentioned and the process of going about it.
            Though technically outside the scope of the course, obtaining a
            domain name is susceptible to extremely privacy invasive mechanisms
            out there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web hosting is also discussed (because you probably do not want to
            host your own website at home).
        </p>
        <h2>No JavaJam Assignment, But Research Question</h2>
        <p>
            The weekly assignment was not JavaJam, but instead Question 1 under
            Web Research.  I think most will just get over this one quickly
            with Google searches, but the activity nonetheless will show you
            the actual minimum costs of just having a functioning website.
