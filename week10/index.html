            <h1>Week 10: Comparison of 3 Web Host Providers</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Instead of a JavaJam assignment this week, we completed #1 from Web Research, which was about researching 3 web host providers satisfying the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Support PHP and MySQL</li>
                <li>Offer e-commerce capabilities</li>
                <li>Provide at least 1GB of disk space</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Table of Results</h2>
            <p>
                Below is a table that summarizes my findings.<br>
                (All prices were current as of November 14, 2020 and all listed plans were the least expensive plans that had e-commerce features or were recommended for e-commerce.)
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>*No setup fees were able to be found without resorting to checking out an actual order with a credit card.</li>
                <li>**E-commerce packages/services and options seemed to be already included by default for all 3 providers.</li>
