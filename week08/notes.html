        <h1>Week 8 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            I just lost everything because I forgot that<br>
            <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Backspace</code><br> 
            on the AlphaSmart 3000 deletes everything after the cursor (instead
            of performing a Windows-like delete, like on a Mac), so I will have
            to recall the basic ideas of what I originally wanted to say...
        </p>
        <h2>General Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Chapter 8 has a lot of information to look at and become familiar
            with, but not to memorize.  In the real world, you would be looking
            up references if making a web site in bare HTML and CSS and with a
            static site generator for others who want a hassle free experience.
        </p>

            This is literally the second shortest code writing chapter.  I would
            expect most people to finish this chapter (as in the exercises)
            between 30 minutes to 1 hour, if not even quicker.  
        </p>

            Oh yes, try to make your tables accessible -- even if it is a bit
            tedious for the website author.  It helps a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are these CSS structural pseudoclasses in tables.  You can
            use these to make really fancy tables (specific rules for the first
            row, the last row, or odd/even rows).  If you enjoyed partial
            differential equations, then conceptually you will like the rules
            here.  It is almost like mathematical or high-level abstract
            mathematics, but the book never dwells on this for too long or
            reaches that.  It is probably just to help the IT students along in
            most intended classrooms so that they can get COMPTIA+ certified or
            something.
        </p>

            This is also where parent and child elements are discussed (as in,
            it is somewhat important conceptually, while earlier it could be
            somewhat ignored without any loss of understanding) - it is
            supposed to reinforce the same concept when you administer actual
            OSes, such as remote Linux servers, which need parent and child
            processes to be watched or monitored - something among those lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            This chapter on HTML tables is pretty straightforward.  Don't sweat
            thing!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you've made it to Chapter 8, then you'll make it to the end of
            this course just fine.
        </p>
        <h2>JavaJam Assignment</h2>
        <p>
            The JavaJam assignment could be done within 30 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just be careful when constructing the table.  Drawing the table out
            and sketching out an HTML skeleton outline by hand will help with
            your accuracy of writing the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            Otherwise, the hardest part will be putting in the accessibility
            tags into the table.
