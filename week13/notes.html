        <h1>Week 13 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            Web promotion is the general subject of this chapter.  For a
            chapter with a JavaJam assignment, this has to be the shortest one,
            relative to the length of the chapter.  I will get into why below.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only major thematic subject you need to know is about search
            engines.
        </p>
        <p>
            This chapter gets you acquainted with the bare HTML way to help
            your website get indexed by popular search engines.  
        </p>
        <h2>General Notes</h2>
        <p>
            The origin story of the rise of search engines is this: in order to
            visit any interesting websites, you would have to know the full URL
            of the website you wanted to navigate to in advance.  Yes, it
            sounds a bit like an infinite ingress problem or the chicken and
            the egg problem.  If you misspelled the URL, then there was no easy
            third-party way to know what you should have typed in.  (We will
            ignore reputation attacks and cyber squatting, for the sake of
            simplicity.)  That is the heuristic need that search engines
            fulfilled.  Out of the early 2000-nots, Google has risen to be the
            most dominant.  Now you know the absolute bare minimum on the
            beginning of Google, from a conceptual point of view.  (We also
            have to ignore the later and more relevant part of Google's
            history, which is namely the backdooring of Google by TLAs, to keep
            this shorter than 1,000 pages.)
        </p>
        <p>
            It is mentioned that Yahoo gets its primary search results from
            Google... I find this hard to believe, because Yahoo was always,
            is, and probably will continue to be inferior to Google - no matter
            how you feel about Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ironically, besides adding a <code>meta</code> tag to the header of
            a bare HTML webpage is the bare minimum.  (Conversely, you can tell
            web crawlers from search engines to not index your site with the
            same <code>robots.txt</code> technique - if you wish for your
            website to not be indexed by search engine crawlers or spiders for
            various and valid reasons.)
        </p>
        <p>
            In Section 13.4, a rule of thumb of not giving every webpage on
            your site the same page title is sometimes even ignored.  Usually,
            this happens only on very small sites, but I suppose not everyone
            gets the same standard media literacy training since not everyone
            has taken an HTML class.  Also, when the textbook mentioned that
            search tags should not be spammed, I just remember how YouTube was
            like in 2010 - some videos tried to get clicks by adding so many
            tags that it would require at least 2-3 pages to print all of the
            tags out on paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, "content of value" has been forgotten in 2020.  The
            top 10%-25% of trending videos on YouTube have little to no value
            anymore...
        </p>
        <p>
            In Section 13.5, I cannot believe you need a Google account to
            submit a free request for Google to list your site - if this does
            not already happen automatically in 2020.  I suppose this is to
            prevent spam or other social engineering attacks, but it makes me
            uncomfortable that a lot of the internet is turning into a literal
            kindergarten class, where you need to ask permission to basically
            do anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, please stop using paid ads on conventional search engines,
            such as on Google.  I suppose the ads on DuckDuckGo are ok, since
            the ads are not really interactive, not animated, and not generated
            by privacy-invasive AI neural networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I kind of wished websites had site maps, but that would be
            impossibly large for sites like Twitter and Instagram (even for the
            public accounts, ignoring that accounts can change between public
            and private at any given time).
        </p>
        <p>
            As I have prematurely stated, one does not need to default to
            Google Analytics for web analytics.  There are other open-source
            analytics tools out there, ready for further adoption!
        </p>
        <p>
            Alexa web rankings (not to be confused with Amazon Alexa) are a
            common sight for me, since any major company with a website (which
            is actually almost all of them) have accompanying Alexa rankings in
            their respective Wikipedia articles.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Section 13,8, social media optimization is... a dirty matter.  I
            suppose it may be necessary, since having an official yet inactive,
            quiet, and noncontroversial social media presence is better than
            having none which inherently carries the risk of false reputation
            attacks.  (This risk can never vanish, even with an official social
            media presence, but at least official presence is better than
            none.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel that many sites are guilty of forgetting what RSS feeds are,
            which is quite unfortunate.  I think even Firefox still has a
            built-in graphical RSS feed.  This allows for your (potentially
            technically more inclined) audience to keep tabs on your latest
            company news blog without constantly having to check for any new
            changes by hand in the browser.  One rule of thumb: please <emph>do
            not</emph> truncate the RSS entries (to the first 100 characters,
            or something like that).  Even though not all RSS readers in
            general can convey all of the visual formatting, at least the
            text-only RSS entries can be read entirely in an RSS reader.  Not
            everyone wants to open up a browser just to look at a text-only
            webpage... well, I am not convinced to do so - unless your site has
            a good dark theme.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Section 13.9, QR codes are mentioned.  Apparently, the QR means
            "Quick Response".  QR is apparently a term with copyrights or
            trademarks, but I think it may be headed in a direction much like
            rolodex or velcro - words that were  copyrighted on paper but are
            used so ubiquitously that legal enforcement is practically
            impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, I recommend using QR codes for printing out, especially
            when you intend your audience to quickly navigate to a target
            website via a mobile device (with a built-in camera, of course).
            (More traditional laptops and desktops though do not get to really
            utilize QR codes - at least not as easily and/or in a
            straightforward manner with respect to maximal usability.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Affiliate programs probably make you think about YouTube videos
            filled with affiliate links and sponsored segments.  Yes, it could
            be considered "annoying", but at least it is less invasive than
            YouTube's built-in ads that the site injects into YouTube videos
            (when using YouTube proper).
        </p>
        <p>
            Banner ads are mentioned - probably not the best idea, unless they
            are small (in size) image ads that only use HTML and CSS.  Yes,
            that would mean non-dynamic content, but those sort of small sites
            that actually post relevant static content ads are miles better
            than whatever infinite stream of JavaScript ads are providing these
            days.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of newsletters do not add content of value anymore.  In fact,
            a lot of them are basically an additional avenue of online
            tracking, if you subscribe to the newsletter of an unscrupulous
            site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forums are still part of the internet, but has been largely
            superseded by mainstream social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditional media ads - reminds me that Apple only runs traditional
            ads on TV, newspapers, and billboards.  Any YouTube video the
            company uploads has the comments turned off, and I would not be
            surprised at all if Apple limited replies to its legion of Twitter
            accounts to mentioned accounts only.  Yeah, so much for the classic
            anti-1984 Orwellian TV commercial that Apple created - either you
            die a hero or you live long enough to become the villain when it
            comes to <emph>all</emph> corporations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 13.10 offers the only Hand-on Practice exercise in all of
            the chapter, which is displaying a YouTube video in an inline
            frame.  The technique may be extended to any other video provider
            (such as Vimeo, DailyMotion, or PeerTube), so the exercise is
            pretty good.
        </p>
        <h2>JavaJam Assignment</h2>
        <p>
            All you need from Section 13.4 is the following HTML code from this
            section:<br>
            <code>
                &lt;meta name="description" content="(Your web page description goes here.)"&gt;
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The JavaJam weekly assignment is the shortest JavaJam assignment.
            Simply add description meta tags for search engines to pick up for
            all pages on the JavaJam site.  The "Description Meta Tag" section
            in Section 13.4 will give you the HTML code template you need.  You
            are copying and pasting 1 additional line that does not change the
            output, but remember to change the description to be unique for
            every JavaJam webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the way, the textbook treats Chapter 9 as the last required
            JavaJam assignment - however, you should simply copy the latest
            JavaJam assignment.  For example, if you did Chapter 11's JavaJam
            assignment, then copy Chapter 11's work for Chapter 13's JavaJam
            assignment.
