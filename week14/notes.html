        <h1>Week 14 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            This is the last chapter - you have done really well if you made it
            this far!  I genuinely mean it, since the difficulty of the course
            goes way down after Chapter 9.  So, if you are considering
            withdrawing or doing pass/fail for this HTML course, then keep this
            in mind.  (Obviously, this advice only supplements and does not
            replace actually speaking to an academic advisor or your
            professor/instructor.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Just do the practice exercises and go along with the exercises.
            JavaScript should be its own computer science course, so this is
            just an overview for good exposure.
        </p>
        <h2>General Notes</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is responsible for in-browser popup prompts.  (This is
            not to be confused with popup ads opening in separate browser
            windows, which nearly all browsers should block by default now in
            2021.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Javascript is mostly responsible for making the internet function
            as a usable tool in 2021, whether you like it or not.  (This is why
            I think there is no practical hope in reviving the Gopher protocol
            or making Gemini mainstream, instead of HTTPS.)
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is often unfortunately confused with Java, due to the
            similarity in name.  However, all similarities start and end in
            name only.  Today, JavaScript and its related technologies make
            webpages dynamically interactive.  On the other hand, one
            application Java is best known for is for developing the Android as
            an OS and also for developing Android apps (though this is slowly
            being replaced by Kotlin).
        </p>
        <p>
            In Section 14.3, JavaScript is shown to be responsible for nearly
            all alert messages - this is spectacularly abused by websites
            trying to fool you into thinking that your computer has been hacked
            with a fake "Your computer has a virus!" message.  (However, if you
            do fall for the site's deception and follow its instructions, then
            you will most certainly get a virus on your Windows computer.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, popup windows have been historically abused so much that
            website builders should avoid popups entirely.  If there is some
            reason that you absolutely have to use popup windows, then please
            put an explicit written note stating that users should be expecting
            a popup window.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mouse movement techniques remind me that JavaScript essentially
            allows Facebook to track your mouse cursor in real time in order to
            try to guess your psychological state... I am really not making
            this up - however, that is a major digression.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jump menus and displaying dynamic submenus are legitimate reasons
            to use JavaScript - though I am pretty sure these can also be
            implemented in modern CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Practice 14.1, some debugging is done with JavaScript via the
            web developer console in Firefox or Chrom* browsers.  There is
            probably a better way for JavaScript debugging purposes, but the
            textbook's method will work for the final chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Practice 14.2, use the given code as the basis for your work in
            the weekly JavaJam assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Section 14.7, the variable naming convention for JavaScript is
            mentioned.  Variables can have names such as
            <code>variableNameHere</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Section 14.8, the scripting programming aspects of JavaScript
            are mentioned.  Unlike markdown languages such as HTML and CSS,
            scripting languages such as JavaScript can be used to compute some
            basic arithmetic operations and handle conditional if-then
            statements for decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the "Functions" subsection of Section 14.8, the one really
            useful purpose JavaScript has in an online form is the reset button
            - which can come in handy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Section 14.9, form handling is discussed.  Server-side
            validation will be required in order to check whether the form was
            filled out correctly, which inevitably requires JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 14.8 mentions the difference between global vs. local
            variables in passing.  Section 14.9 attempts to discuss that
            <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are booleans, not strings,
            while avoiding mentioning the word "boolean" explicitly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JavaScript server-side processing PHP script is not doing
            anything besides passing a signal back to the user saying that the
            information as been received and it repeats the what the user input
            in the form.  (If I recall correctly, the PHP script only acts
            trivially and does not even record any information.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Plain JavaScript is probably ok for simple alert message boxes, but
            not that much more.  (Mouseover events can be a bit annoying.)
            However, some users disable JavaScript or have Tor Browser on the
            highest security setting (which completely disables JavaScript), so
            you have to be mindful of the needs of all of your users.  This is
            why I like Nitter - Nitter does not require JavaScript to work at
            all, and it feels fast and snappy (compared to other websites - we
            are talking about hundreds of milliseconds, but I am not measuring
            everything like a benchmark fanatic).
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 14.12 talks about jQuery.  To be honest, I would recommend
            steering clear of jQuery for simple JavaScript activities.  jQuery
            is only somewhat useful if you require some complex JavaScript
            scenario and the lines of code of jQuery would be much shorter than
            manually coding plain JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only the Hands-on Practice 14.11 exercise is somewhat justified in
            using jQuery.
        </p>
        <h2>JavaJam Assignment</h2>
        <p>
            For the weekly JavaJam assignment, I would recommend going the
            JavaScript route, not the jQuery route.  There is no real benefit
            of using a jQuery CDN to produce just 1 output line that states
            when the webpage was last modified.
