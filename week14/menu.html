                <p><!--Book's prompt was really vague on where to place the mouseover anchor...-->
                    Indulge in our locally roasted free-trade coffee and enjoy the aroma, the smooth taste, the caffeine! Join our 
                    <a href="#" onmouseover="alert('JavaJam Mug Club Members get a 10% discount on each cup of coffee!');">Mug Club</a>
                    and get a 10% discount on each cup of coffee you purchase &mdash; ask the barista for details. 
                </p><!--But based on the book's screenshot, I can barely see 
                the anchor's over the words "Mug Club".
                Makes sense, I guess, but I'd rather have clearer instructions
                for a task like this, b/c I almost robotically made the whole
                paragraph a mouseover anchor.
                Even for "tech savvy" ppl, a mouseover like this would startle
                me, but I'm just following the assignment's instructions...  -->
