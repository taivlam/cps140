        <h1>Week 2 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            A lot of reading on the preliminaries of HTML and shows you the
            ropes of doing things around HTML.  Due to this, the chapter is
            very easy and straightforward.  (How appropriate!)  However, this
            chapter foreshadows a systemic issue of a certain economical PDF
            copy of the book: the teletype font (TTF) code blocks that are
            "quite long" (i.e., supposed to wrap down to the next line, if you
            use a GUI text editor) often run off into the right margin, instead
            of being wrapped properly down to the next line...
        </p>
        <p>
            This systemic issue can be partially "fixed" or ameliorated by
            examining what the output is supposed to look like in the pictures
            of the Figures for Hands-On Exercises (assuming they are 100%
            correct -- a few of the towards the end of the second half of the
            book, Chapters 9-14, have "incorrect" pictures in Figures that most
            likely correspond to older editions of the book).

            Since this is the first chapter using the JavaJam website
            assignment that lasts for the rest of the course, the JavaJam
            assignment is easy.  In fact, the book literally tells you what to
            type.  Appropriate, but this only lasts during Chapters 2-4.

            You are told to be aware of some other markdown "languages" XML and
            XHTML (which are considered to be "old", but you may still come 
            across websites that still use these), but you will work with 
            HTML5 exclusively in this class.
        </p>

            This is where there are "motifs" throughout the book, some
            exercises will return to "mini businesses", such as Trillium.  It
            is a bit corny and fun in a way.  I suppose it is to help you
            learn.  Not necessary, though I think this may be helpful due to
            something in psychology - even if these businesses are fake.

        <h3>Interesting Observation for Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            Interestingly, this is where I learned that making clickable URLs
            that say "Click here" or "More Info" is really not a good practice
            for accessible web development.  It took a while for that point to
            sink in, but I eventually started to apply this whenever I post
            links on Reddit or making links in Markdown.  (Besides, if your URL
            contains underscores, then you need to escape each and every
            underscore in the display text of a link in Markdown, which can be
            tedious if there are many underscores - Reddit links have lots of
            underscores, as an example.  This shows that learning accessibility
            in one language pays off when you learn another language that 
            piggybacks off the ideas of the parent language: in this case, 
            Markdown inherits these ideas from HTML.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides, your online messages will now look a lot neater, without 
            bare URLs sticking out everywhere.  (I know that sometimes it can 
            be preferred to show the whole URL, but that comes from malicious 
            and/or spam e-mails or messages.  The internet was never created 
            with a lot of privacy or security in its early days, which ended up 
            being rather painful afterthoughts down the road.  Regardless, we 
            are going to assume there is some semblance of trust, from the 
            creator of the web content creator, and also from the user, who 
            should make sure that at least the link is not sketchy by using the 
            mouse hover technique.)
