        <h1>Week 7 - Notes</h1>
        <p>
            Chapter 7 is the final core foundation chapter - if you can make it
            through this chapter with JavaJam, then I am willing to vouch that
            you can make it to the end of this course.  This is the last "hard"
            chapter, because all subsequent chapters after Chapter 7 are easier
            due to being relatively "self-contained".  Chapters 2-4 and 6-7
            keep linearly building up on top of each other's work.
        </p>
        <p>
            I strongly recommend doing the actual JavaJam assignment.  (I
            honestly do not know why there is an option to do a short essay-like
            assignment.)  You will be missing out on a lot for having your
            JavaJam site functioning the way it should by the end of the
            course.

        <h2>General Collected Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            By now, if you have not figured out a workflow with the class, then
            you can really speed up your process of checking the HTML you wrote
            with the corresponding sample solution by opening up each
            respective webpage in your preferred web browser of choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            (I was using Firefox then, but then transitioned to LibreWolf.)
        </p>
        <p>
            (I cannot use Brave or Ungoogled Chromium, because I have enabled
            the Chrome flag for native darkening of the webpage and I also use
            Dark Reader on both of them.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I think some website creators forget that more than 90% of mobile
            devices do not have any sort of stylus (looking at Samsung and its
            S Pen styluses), so you cannot hover over buttons to access mouse
            hover activated menus, like on a laptop or desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is much better to design for a mobile-friendly website from the
            beginning and from the top down, rather than trying to make your
            website mobile friendly after the fact.  Although I personally
            do not feel comfortable reading paragraphs of text longer than a
            "short" 5 sentence paragraph on any mobile device (especially a
            smartphone out of all devices! Who thought it's fun to read
            Wikipedia on a smartphone?!?), I think too many websites try to
            cram too much sheer content onto any given "mobile-friendly"
            webpage.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 7.1</h3>
        <p>
            The section starts off with relative linking. This is creating a
            hyperlink to files or other webpages by going deeper into a
            relative file path or by rising up 1 relative level to access an
            adjacent directory... this is when I realized this is exactly what
            I was doing in "the terminal" (technically terminal emulator
            instances).  I love how knowing Linux helps you out in surprising
            ways in other distant parts of technology, but Windows never leads
            you anywhere outside of its closed-sourced, walled garden/sphere of
            influence that Microsoft gatekeeps for no reason.  (It's the
            "trick" where you rise up 1 directory level with<br>
            <code>$ cd ../</code><br>
            if you didn't know what I was talking about without referencing the
            book itself.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Also in Section 7.1 is the fragment identifiers - this is how
            Wikipedia jumps down to the section or subsection you clicked on
            when you look at an article's "table of contents".  It's a bit
            tedious to write the HTML for a fragment identifier, but it is worth
            the effort once you have it completely set up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apparently one can make hyperlinks to telephone numbers and even
            sending SMS text messages -- though, to be honest these sound
            somewhat annoying and would never work on a traditional desktop or
            laptop operating system.  I suppose this could be convenient for a
            mobile version of a website (such as a result in DuckDuckGo for a
            real business).  I still would only use this functionality if I was
            using a phone with no Google Play services (so, running one of
            these phone OSes: GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, or LineageOS for microG).
        </p>
        <h3>Section 7.2</h3>
        <p>
            In Section 7.2, CSS sprites are discussed.  I think that the
            resource management manipulation trick of selectively displaying
            non-overlapping sections of a sprite graphics file is very clever,
            though I wished the book would elaborate more how this can be used
            to keep the size of a plain HTML and CSS webpage much smaller than
            1MB.  (This was when I learned outside of class that websites
            become much larger than 1MB once privacy invasive analytics, such
            as Google Analytics, are added.  This is very unfortunate that is
            considered customarily ok to create webpages much larger than
            1-10MB -- not everyone lives in areas of the world with good
            telecommunications infrastructure with higher than 1Gbps Ethernet
            speeds...
        </p>
        <h3>Section 7.5</h3>
        <p>
            In Part 1 of Practice 7.5, the image file extension should be
            <code>.jpg</code>, not <code>.png</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section mentions one way to design a mobile web site is to
            create a separate mobile-friendly site with a <code>.mobi</code>
            TLD.  That sounds like the Internet from 2008.  No one should do
            this technique in 2020 and that is probably not the best way to
            implement progressive web design.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 7.8</h3>
        <p>
            After reading this section, responsive images are really cool -
            once you have written the HTML and made sure it is error free.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 7.9</h3>
        <p>
            In this section, you can finally see it really pays off to create a
            GitHub Page for your JavaJam site.  You can just navigate to your
            GH Page site to test how well your mobile display functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section reminds me that you need to pay Apple money to develop
            even open source apps for MacOS/iOS -- this is why I can't even
            deal with the idea of owning an Apple device.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Practice 7.10, please ignore the <code>w</code> units for
            picture widths in Step #2.  I have no idea why the <code>w</code>'s
            are there.
        </p>
        <h3>Sections 7.10-7.11</h3>
        <p>
            These sections were semi-skipped in class because they were not
            emphasized.  I believe the CSS flexible box layout was not used as
            widely before 2017-2018 (when the ninth edition of this book was
            published) as now - but it is 2021 and it is being used everywhere.
            Pay attention if you are set to work in front-end web development
            with HTML and CSS is what I feel is actually the truth.  Also,
            ironically you still need to answer questions about the CSS
            flexible box layout and the grid layout for the quiz... I guess
            just use Quizlet search results if you're really stuck?
        </p>
        <h2>JavaJam Assignment</h2>
        <p>
            For the JavaJam assignment, if you truly do not have a physical
            tablet and/or smartphone to test your progressive web or mobile
            friendly site, then you can simply simulate a phone/tablet display
            by changing the dimensions of Firefox/Chromium with the mouse.
            (There's also the actual mobile device simulator when you press
            <code>F12</code> in Firefox or Chromium for the browser console,
            a.k.a. the "developer's area", if you feel like exploring that,
            too.)
